# Odin Rock Paper Scissors Project

This repo contains my solution to The Odin Projects "Rock Paper Scissors" section. 

The goal is to establish a functioning game of rock paper scissors, currently only displayed in the console. At a later lesson, this repo will be re-utilized to explore the addition of UI elements and further user interactivity.
